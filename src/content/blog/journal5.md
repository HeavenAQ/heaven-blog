# Theme

The theme that I choose is `Environmental Protection`. The following three photos are the ones I took during my trip to Kenting last weekend. They are related to environmental protection, for they all show the beauty of the nature. Those breathtaking views in the photos really remind me of the importance of environmental protection. If we `keep ruining our environment` without the awareness of conservation, we will soon `lose those beautiful sceneries in the near future.`

# \* Breath in Kenting's Mountain: A Lesson on Air Pollution

As an NSYSU student, I do not enjoy mountain sightseeing very much since it is almost a daily agenda for me. However, my `mountain sightseeing experience in Kenting` was totally `different` from the one in our school, especially `in terms of the air.` The air in the mountains of Kenting permeated with the scent of the soil combined with a hint of the salt from the sea water. It was clean, refreshing and even relaxing to me. Its pleasing scent prompted me to reflect upon the damages that air pollution could cause. Our campus, swarmed with scooters everywhere, has already lost the fragrance that mountains should have. Wherever I am in our campus, I could always smell a bit of chemical odor. Sometimes, when the air quality goes down, the entire campus would even look yellowish. This is the reason that I mark this photo, for that it enables to have a deeper understanding on how air pollution could ruin our environment.

# Unseen Threats to Ocean Serenity

The ocean view in Kenting was also amazing. I especially like the places where I could appreciate the beauty of ocean without the distraction of people just like the one in the photo. With only the mossy rocks and white-capped wave rolling back and forth on the shore, the ocean formed a `serene atmosphere` which relaxed me a lot. Sitting on the shore and staring at the ocean, I started to think that maybe plastic bags are not the only pollutions humans made to the ocean. Those `water sports` we enjoy a lot on summer days could also be the source of pollution since they `break the serenity provided by the ocean.`

# Diving into Awareness

It was the first time that I experienced water snorkeling. I was stunned by the underwater view. The ocean was so clear that I could see the fish swimming around me. The coral reefs were also beautiful. I was so amazed by the beauty of the underwater world. That scene had me realize that why coral bleaching could be a serious problem.I understood how the loss of these reefs could strip the ocean of its stunning biodiversity, turning this colorful underwater paradise into a barren wasteland.
