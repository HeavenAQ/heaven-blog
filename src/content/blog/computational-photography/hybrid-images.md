# Hybrid Images

## Introduction

- Two different interpretations of a picture can be perceived by
 - changing the viewing distance
 - changing the presentation time

---

### Generation of Hybrid Images

- generated by superimposing two images at two different spatial scales

$$
H = I_1 \cdot G_1 + I_2 \cdot (1 - G_2)
$$

- `Low-spatial Frequencies`
 - Frequency cut of the low resolution
 - The one that can be seen at a far distance
 - An image $(I_1)$ that is filtered by low-pass filter
 - Gaussian Filter $(G_1)$
- `High-spatial Frequencies`
 - Frequency cut of the high resolution
 - The one that can be seen up close
 - An image $(I_2)$ that is filtered by high-pass filter
 - Laplacian Filter $(1 - G_2)$

## The Perception of Hybrid Images

> [!NOTE]
> Human observers can comprehend the meaning of a novel image within a short glance (100 msec)

- When observation time is limited, low frequencies are observed.
- Different durations lead to different results of observations.

## Successful Hybrid Image

1. When one percept dominates, it's impossible to conciously switch between the alternative.
 - Alternative can only be seen by the change of distance
2. The `alternative` must be treated as `noises`

### 1. What $\sigma$ Does in Your Function

- `sigma_low` → controls how much of **im1** is blurred.

 - Small $\sigma$: keeps more detail (not blurry enough).
 - Large $\sigma$: very blurred, only coarse structure remains.

- `sigma_high` → controls how much of **im2**'s detail is kept.

 - Small $\sigma$: subtracts only very fine details → result may look faint.
 - Large $\sigma$: subtracts a lot of content → result may contain too much, overpowering the hybrid.

So the balance is:

- Low-pass must preserve **shape / identity** of im1.
- High-pass must keep **edges / texture** of im2.

## 2. Use the Plotting Method to Guide Choice

Here’s how you can **plot the frequency responses** of your chosen sigmas and see if they complement each other well:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_filters(sigma_low, sigma_high, fmax=60):
 f = np.linspace(0, fmax, 500)

 # Low-pass response
 H_low = np.exp(-(f**2) / (2 * sigma_low**2))

 # High-pass response
 H_high = 1 - np.exp(-(f**2) / (2 * sigma_high**2))

 plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
 plt.plot(f, H_low, 'r', linewidth=2, label=f"Low-pass σ={sigma_low}")
 plt.plot(f, H_high, 'g', linewidth=2, label=f"High-pass σ={sigma_high}")
 plt.xlabel("Frequency (cycles/image)")
 plt.ylabel("Gain")
 plt.legend()
 plt.grid(True, linestyle=":")
 plt.title("Filter Frequency Responses")
 plt.show()

# Example:
plot_filters(sigma_low=8, sigma_high=20)
```

- If the curves **cross smoothly around 0.5 gain** → you get something like fig (a) in your reference image.
- If there is a **gap** (both near 0 in mid frequencies) → you get something like fig (b). This means some frequencies are lost, making the hybrid less convincing.

---

## 3. Practical Way to Tune Sigmas

1. **Start with rule of thumb**:

 - `sigma_low` ≈ 8–12 (to blur im1 enough to remove detail but keep recognizability).
 - `sigma_high` ≈ 2–6 (to extract edges from im2).

2. **Plot the filter curves** with the function above.

 - Make sure the low-pass is strong at low frequencies and has faded out before the high-pass kicks in.

3. **Check the hybrid in Fourier domain**:

 - Plot radial spectrum of your hybrid and overlay filters.
 - You’ll see whether your chosen sigmas complement each other (no big gap, no big overlap).

---

## 4. What to Look For in a “Good” Hybrid

- **Near range** (look close): High frequencies dominate → you should see **im2**.
- **Far range** (look far or zoom out): High frequencies disappear → you should see **im1**.

That only happens if your frequency split is clean — which is why plotting the curves is so useful.

## Rules of Perceptual Grouping and Hybrid Image

### 1. Fewer elements in low spatial frequncies

- Low spatial frequencies (blob) `lack` a `precise definition` of object shapes and `region boundaries`
- Users tend to interpret elements in the simplest way possible.

### 2. Avoid symmetry and repetitiveness in low spatial frequencies

- Symmetry and repetitiveness forms a strong percept that is hard to eliminate perpetually.
- The patterns would always remain visible even when viewing from a short distance

### 3. Color provides a very strong grouping cue

- Color is used only in the high frequencies

### 4. Choosing a proper cut-off frequencies for the filter

- Avoid strong filter overlap to provide unambiguous interpretation when viewing from different distances away.

## Correlation and Hybrid Image

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Scale, Edge, and Frequencies**
>
> - **Scale**: The level of detail or resolution
> - _coarse scale:_ low frequencies, blurs away details
> - _fine scale:_ high frequencies, preserves details
> - **Edge**
> - where the sharp changes occurs in intensity or color
> - local minima in the image gradient
> - **Frequencies**
> - How rapidly intensity changes over a short distance

### a)

- The edges found at one scale are correlated with the edges found in the scales below and above.

### b)

- The same when two images are superimposed (additive transparency).

### c)

- The same also holds when an image is blurred.

### d)

- The correlation is corrupted when white noises are added.

## Subband and Scale

> [!NOTE]

> - High frequencies: a stern woman
> - Low frequencies: an angry man

- Each subband is also a hybrid image.
- The finer the scale of each subban, the farther you have to go in order to see the switch of images
